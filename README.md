**What it is**

Our project is an AI-enhanced platform providing improved user friendly access to information about Brazilian politicians. While the Brazilian Government provides a robust transparency portal, it can be daunting for users to navigate the system to get a complete overview of information about specific politicians’ platforms and voting history.

The goal of the application is to help Brazilian voters identify which politicians truly represent their interests.

**What it is not**

We do not in any way seek to influence how users choose to vote.

**Misinformation**

A very real concern in any application making use of AI to provide information to users is that they will unintentionally be exposed to inaccurate information.

We seek to reduce the potential of providing misinformation by using two AI Agents: one with instructions to display requested information to the user, and another to check whether the displayed information is accurate based on the available data and the user’s request.

While the extra ‘reviewing Agent’ will likely reduce misinformation shown to the user, the chance remains that both Agents will get something wrong. We will always display a disclaimer to the user as well as sources for statements made in the AI’s response.

**Usage and Monitoring**

No data is saved during user interactions with the service. That means each prompt sent to the chatbot includes whatever context is defined by the model in use.
